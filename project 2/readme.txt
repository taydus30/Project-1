This project is intended for upper Division credit.


Our program is general, and you are able to give it any dna sequence and
it allows you to import .txt or .json files or manually input the sequence
you would like to run. You are able to calculate the dna compliment to the
sequence, the mRNA of the sequence, the gc_comparison, the base frequencies,
it allows you to compare your sequence to another sequence, and it allows you
to generate either 1 mutation, or a list of mutations through iterations.

project_2.py is the file containing our DNA class and all the functions described above.

mutation_visualization.py is a file that gives an example of how to use our library.
It is a graphical Visualization of a DNA sequence that color-codes the bases, and
lets the user advance to see the sequence mutate over several generations and observe
changes to the GC composition and base frequencies. In order to run this file you
will need to install pygame to view graphics: pip3 install pygame
