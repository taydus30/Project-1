Our program is general, and you are able to give it any dna sequence and
it allows you to import .txt or .json files or manually input the sequence
you would like to run. You are able to calculate the dna compliment to the
sequence, the mRNA of the sequence, the gc_comparison, the base frequencies,
it allows you to compare your sequence to another sequence, and it allows you
to generate either 1 mutation, or a list of mutations through iterations. Our
program also allows you to read the outputs in a user friendly window and step
through the generations with color coded visual mutations.
